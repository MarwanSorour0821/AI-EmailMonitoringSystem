# AI-EmailMonitoringSystem
This is an email monitoring system that identifies phishing attacks by using machine learning to prevent employees being scammed.


The Email monitoring system is one of the most helpful cybersecurity machine learning use cases. Phishing attacks entail approaching employees for personal information about their jobs, banking and credit card information, workplace passwords, and other private information via fraudulent emails. In this cybersecurity machine learning project, you will utilize machine learning techniques to prevent these email scams by scanning the employees' business emails and looking for any traits that would point to a cybersecurity concern. Additionally, you will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to examine emails for any suspicious language or patterns that point to a phishing attempt.
